    "\n",
    "- **Aggregation** is demonstrated by the `Customer` class **\"having an\" Address** as part of its attributes (`address`).\n",
    "- The `Customer` object does not directly define or manage the properties of the `Address`. Instead, it uses an independent `Address` object.\n",
    "- Changes to the `Address` (via `edit_addresss`) affect the `Customer` object because the `Customer` holds a reference to the `Address` object.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Points:**\n",
    "1. **Independent `Address` Object:**  \n",
    "   The `Address` object (`address1`) exists separately and is passed to the `Customer` constructor.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Interaction with `Address`:**  \n",
    "   - The `Customer` uses methods like `get_city()` and `edit_addresss()` from the `Address` class to retrieve and modify its data.\n",
    "   - Modifications to the `Address` reflect automatically in the `Customer` as they share the same object.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Workflow:**  \n",
    "   - Initially, the address is set to `\"Roorkee, Haridwar-247667, India\"`.\n",
    "   - After calling `edit_profile`, the `Address` object is updated to `\"Mumbai, Maharashtra-400001, India\"`, and `Customer` reflects this change.\n"

This enables code reuse, hierarchy creation, and easy extension of existing functionality.\n",

    "   Common features can be defined in the parent class and reused in child classes.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Hierarchy:**  \n",
    "   Inheritance establishes a \"is-a\" relationship between classes, e.g., a `Dog` \"is-a\" type of `Animal`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Customization:**  \n",
    "   Child classes can override or extend the methods and attributes of the parent class.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Multiple and Multilevel Inheritance:**  \n",
    "   Python supports:\n",
    "   - **Single Inheritance:** One parent, one child.\n",
    "   - **Multiple Inheritance:** One child class inherits from multiple parent classes.\n",
    "   - **Multilevel Inheritance:** A child class inherits from another child class.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Benefits of Inheritance**\n",
    "- Simplifies code by reducing redundancy.\n",
    "- Promotes modularity and maintainability.\n",
    "- Enables polymorphism, allowing dynamic method overriding.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Limitations**\n",
    "- Overuse of inheritance can make code harder to debug and maintain.\n",

    "1. **Abstract Base Classes (ABCs):**\n",
    "   - Defined using the `abc` module.\n",
    "   - Classes with one or more abstract methods are abstract classes.\n",
    "2. **Abstract Methods:**\n",
    "   - Methods declared but not implemented in an abstract class.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Advantages of Abstraction**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Reduces Complexity:**\n",
    "   - Users interact with the essential features without worrying about the implementation.\n",
    "2. **Improves Code Reusability:**\n",
    "   - Abstract classes and methods can be reused across different projects.\n",
    "3. **Promotes Flexibility:**\n",
    "   - Allows developers to change implementations without altering the interface.\n",
    "4. **Enhances Security:**\n",
    "   - Hides sensitive or unnecessary details from the end user.\n",
