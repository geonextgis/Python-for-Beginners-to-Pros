    "1. **Aggregation**: Represents a **\"has-a\"** relationship where the contained object can exist independently of the container.  \n",

    "**Brief Explanation of Aggregation in the Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Aggregation** is demonstrated by the `Customer` class **\"having an\" Address** as part of its attributes (`address`).\n",
    "- The `Customer` object does not directly define or manage the properties of the `Address`. Instead, it uses an independent `Address` object.\n",
    "- Changes to the `Address` (via `edit_addresss`) affect the `Customer` object because the `Customer` holds a reference to the `Address` object.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Points:**\n",
    "1. **Independent `Address` Object:**  \n",
    "   The `Address` object (`address1`) exists separately and is passed to the `Customer` constructor.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Interaction with `Address`:**  \n",
    "   - The `Customer` uses methods like `get_city()` and `edit_addresss()` from the `Address` class to retrieve and modify its data.\n",
    "   - Modifications to the `Address` reflect automatically in the `Customer` as they share the same object.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Workflow:**  \n",
    "   - Initially, the address is set to `\"Roorkee, Haridwar-247667, India\"`.\n",
    "   - After calling `edit_profile`, the `Address` object is updated to `\"Mumbai, Maharashtra-400001, India\"`, and `Customer` reflects this change.\n"
